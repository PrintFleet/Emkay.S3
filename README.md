##Getting Started

TODO: Bit on installing via nuget at build time 

In order to use the tasks in your project, you need to import the Emkay.S3.Tasks.targets file. Maybe you need to adjust the paths to your needs.

    <Import Project="Emkay.S3.Tasks.targets"/>

Emkay S3 file publisher is an **MSBuild task** which can be used for publishing a file or set of files to S3. By default the files will be publically accessible. The following target will upload `file.txt` to `path/within_S3/file.txt`:

    <Target Name="S3_upload">
      <Message Text="Publishing to S3 ..." />
      
      <Message Text="Source folder: $(source)"/>
      <Message Text="Bucket: $(S3_bucket)"/>
      <Message Text="Destination folder: $(S3_subfolder)"/>
      
      <PublishFiles
        Key="$(aws_key)"
        Secret="$(aws_secret)"
        SourceFiles="path\to\file.txt"
        Bucket="my_s3_bucket"
        DestinationFolder="path/within_S3" />


  	</Target>


## Examples

### Uploading a folder

You can also recursively publish an entire folder:

      <ItemGroup>
        <UploadFiles Include="localpath\**\*.*" />
      </ItemGroup>
      <PublishFiles
        Key="$(aws_key)"
        Secret="$(aws_secret)"
        SourceFiles="@(UploadFiles)"
        Bucket="$(aws_s3_bucket)"
        DestinationFolder="path/within_S3" />


### Headers

You can set custom headers by using ItemGroup metadata:

      
      <ItemGroup>
        <UploadFiles Include="localpath\**\css\**\*.css">
          <Content-Type>text/css</Content-Type>
          <Content-Encoding>gzip</Content-Encoding>
        </UploadFiles>
        <UploadFiles Include="localpath\**\**\*.json" Exclude="@(UploadFiles)">
          <Content-Type>application/json</Content-Type>
        </UploadFiles>
        <UploadFiles Include="localpath\**\*.*" Exclude="@(UploadFiles)" />
      </ItemGroup>

## Help

All tasks have some common properties:

* *Key*: Required. Your AWS key. Normally you should use a variable, and pass the value as a parameter to MSBuild or read it from somewhere outside of source control (a file or registry).
* *Secret*: Required. Your AWS secret. Normally you should use a variable, and pass the value as a parameter to MSBuild or read it from somewhere outside of source control (a file or registry).
* *Bucket*: Required. The AWS S3 bucket you are operating on.
* *Region*: The AWS S3 region to use. By default "us-east-1" is used, but any of the [AWS S3 region names](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region) can be used.
